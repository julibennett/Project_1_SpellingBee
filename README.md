# Project_1_SpellingBee

## Project Description
> I am going to create a spelling bee game where the user will interact with the game to listen to audio and then spell words corresponding to the audio that they just heard. The words will progressively get harder as the game goes on. The user will only have a certain amount of time to spell the word before it is counted as incorrect. If you reach a score of 10, you win. Words that are spelled incorrectly will subtract a point from your score. The correctly and incorrectly spelled words will be displayed and color coordinated at the bottom of the screen. There will also be a running timer and scoreboard.

## User Stories
> As a Spelling Bee game user, I want a fast paced, easy to navigate game that challenges my skills with lots of variety and difficulty levels. I would like this because I want to improve my spelling ability in a fun new way that's engaging to my listening and spelling abilities, and mimics a real world spelling bee scenario.

### MVP Goals
> The minimum features needed for this game to work are:
- A functioning scoreboard
- An audio button that plays the word you need to spell
- A space for the user to type in their guess
- Correct and incorrect words logged at the bottom

### Stretch Goals
> A timer that counts down time needed before a user's guess is counted as incorrect. I think this would be a fun add and would make the game a bit more high stakes.
